			<p class="info">As the highest grade of Kenyan coffee and considered to be one of the best Arabica coffees in the world, Kenya AA coffees are all produced from 
			the finest Arabica beans. This can be one of the reasons why people love to buy Kenya AA coffees. The skin of the coffee cherry is first peeled off, after which the 
			remaining beans are left to soak in a tank. Known as wet-processing, leaving the beans to soak in a fermentation tank allows the beans' own enzymes to loosen the residue 
			that remain on their surface. This loosened residue forms a thin, parchment-like layer when the beans are dried in the sun, and can be removed with no trouble at all with a 
			mechanical huller. Beans are graded based on their size following the milling process.</p>

		<div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
			<p class="info">The meticulous roasting process ensures excellence when it comes to coffee. It is well-known all over the world. It is much sought after for its bold, intense, full-bodied 
			flavor that is accompanied by overtones of berry and citrus fruits and mild floral fragrance. Kenya AA coffees have a fast-growing reputation among coffee aficionados as a full-bodied, 
			robustly flavored pick-me-up that has a markedly fruity or winey overtone. This has lead to Kenya AA coffee being described as sweet with a bright acidity that may take some getting used to, and 
			one would do well to make such an effort! Here at the Java Lava Cafe, not only will you be able to sample this exquisite blend of coffee but can purchase for brewing at home!
