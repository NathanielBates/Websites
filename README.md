# Websites
Two websites that I created while attending Seminole State College.  They have php scripting capabilities although since they were just projects, they are unhosted. Copyrighted php scripts for email redirection is included for website functionality.
No outside applications were used in it their creations. All html, css (except bootstrap and foundation elements), Javascript (except from Jquery and lightbox), xml, and xslt were hand-coded by myself.
